## Introduction

Tower uses the concept of **Credentials** to store the keys and tokens necessary to access the [Compute Environments](../../compute-envs/overview) as well as [Git hosting services](../../git/overview). The instructions for adding the credentials are mentioned in the documentation for respective compute environment or git hosting section of this documentation.
